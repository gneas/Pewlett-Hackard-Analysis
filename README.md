# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis Project
A project intended to examine the expected "Silver Tsunami" of current employees reaching retirement age.
## Challenge Overview
An analysis to determine the number of retiring employees by their title, along with identifying the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results
Four major points obtained from the analysis through the following queries.

![Queries](/Queries/Queries.png "Queries")

- Of the retirees reaching retirement age, about 63.7% of them are currently in Senior level positions.
- There aren't enough lower level employees reaching retirement that could be coaxed into assuming the senior level retirees roles.
- Roughly half of the retirees are Engineers and the other half Staff.
- The organization is very top heavy in terms of titles.
## Summary
This "Silver Tsunami" is such that the organization will be hit very hard when employees begin leaving. Given the top-heavy state of the organization, presumably leadership will be impacted severly. According to the counts of retiring titles, there will be 90,398 employees retiring. Unfortunately, of the current employees there are only 1,549 employees that are within the criteria intially established to determine whether or not their are eligible to be mentored. Given this situation, the criteria around what qualifies as "mentorship eligible" needs to be re-examined. It should not be based so heavily on age but rather other more substantive criteria.
